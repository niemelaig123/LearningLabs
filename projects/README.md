## Overview

This is for side projects that I want to be a bit more organized than something in sandbox. They don't need to be large, but need to be treated with a bit more polish, so that means things like writing tests, worrying about running them locally at least, that kind of thing. Any of these that graduate into something worth deploying will probably be moved to their own repository as a flagship project.

## Current Projects

TBD, mainly reorganizing things right now

## Project Standards

This is a sort of how to guide/checklist for me when starting up one of these projects:

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide
- **Code Comments**: Clear explanations for complex logic
- **API Documentation**: Document interfaces and function signatures

### Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript or similar type systems where applicable
- **Testing**: Include unit tests and integration tests
- **Linting**: Follow consistent code style with ESLint/Prettier
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and validation
