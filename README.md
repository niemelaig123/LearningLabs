# LearningLabs

> **Note**: This README was generated with GitHub Copilot. The structure and guidelines described here represent goals and aspirations for this learning repository.

A comprehensive learning repository for exploring concepts in computer science, mathematics, machine learning, and software development through hands-on experimentation and interactive notebooks. That is the goal at least!

## Repository Structure

### [notebooks/](notebooks/)
Interactive Jupyter notebooks for understanding and demonstrating fundamental concepts across various domains:
- **data_science/**: Data analysis, visualization, feature engineering, and statistical methods
- **math/**: Mathematical foundations including calculus, linear algebra, probability, and optimization
- **ml/**: Machine learning concepts from fundamentals to deep learning and generative models

### [projects/](projects/)
Full-featured applications and projects for applying learned concepts:
- Working implementations of real-world applications
- Integration of multiple technologies and frameworks
- Production-ready code examples

### [sandbox/](sandbox/)
Experimental workspace for testing new ideas, technologies, and concepts:
- Quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- Learning new frameworks and libraries
- Testing ground for experimental features

## Purpose

This repository is to track my own learning progress on topics that interest me, and to serve as a sort of inherent accountability tool
